This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` | No (defaults to `ws://localhost:3001`) | Realtime WebSocket backend. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | No | Enables real "Sign in with Google". |

### Enabling real Google sign-in

The "Continue with Google" button works out of the box in **demo mode** — it
signs you in as a fake `demo.user@gmail.com` account with no real Google
account involved, consistent with the rest of this app's dummy-data
fallbacks.

To make it a real Google sign-in:

1. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
   (type "Web application").
2. Add your app's URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000` for local dev) to
   **Authorized JavaScript origins**.
3. Set the Client ID in `frontend/.env.local`:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   ```

4. Restart the dev server. The auth modal will now render the real Google
   button and sign users in with their actual Google account.

Note: the resulting ID token is decoded client-side and never verified
against Google's servers — fine for this demo app (there's no backend to
hand it to), but a real production auth system would verify it server-side.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
